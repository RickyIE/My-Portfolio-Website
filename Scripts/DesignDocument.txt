My portfolio website design document. (MeetAlex.domain)

Page 1 (Index page)
A greeting screen with a blurred background to welcome user with a waving animated hand and a short introduction to the website. If I manage to implement different themes it would present a choice of themes for the user.
* Navigation bar.
* Carousel menu
* Buttons to sort navigation through programming languages
* Mini game window to attract user attention
* Footer with contact details


Page 2 (language page) – name portfolio projects
* Navigation bar
* Footer with contact details
* Separate each language into cards with when highlighted tils slightly sideways. When a card is clicked two buttons similar to the round menu button will present themselves green for open red for close or similar and the card will zoom to the whole screen opening a transparent blurred menu either white or glass with a description of the project


Page 4 (About me page)
* Navigation bar
* A little note about me and my cv below to be viewed plus the option to download it
* Footer with contact details
* Have side glass panels with neon sabres on top folding out words for each year
* All extra online and other courses on the bottom

To do List:
o Implement “Lovely Assistant” a sphere like menu which opens multiple spheres or circles from a main circle. Main purpose is to attract users attention and provide incentive for contact or feedback. Try to implement on the right corner of the screen where the empty space is on the sides. When minimised to a mobile view then change the shape to make sure it doesn’t block view.Try drawing the graphics with www.figma.com
o A second more professional theme
o A third more comics cartoon inspired theme
o Implement font awesome
o Implement floating bubbles, glass or other animation behind all pages background and see if its possible to add parallax backgrounds
o Index load screen just like circle language button (Load circle) with a spinning light in its orbit
